# Return Ready Lab 19

* Part A - Foundations 8.1
* Part B - Foundations 8.2

## Part A

### Example and Activity 01

#### Step 01

In the package `lab19.part_a.examples` look at the file `Example01_ArraySample` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `labs.lab19.part_a.activity` complete the `Activity01_Array` per the following:

        Create a program with an array with any amount of elements
        Per the sample output below, print out each element in order to the console

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output (Abe first name Lincoln last name):
```

Accessing Elements of Array:
First Element: 12
Second Element: 4
Third Element: 5
Fourth Element: 2
Fifth Element: 5

```

> Use Example01_ArraySample for reference.

### Example and Activity 02

#### Step 01

In the package `lab19.part_a.examples` look at the file `Example02_LoopArray` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `labs.lab19.part_b.activity` complete the `Activity02_ArrayLoop` per the following:

        Create a program with an array which contains four unique strings
        Utilize a loop to print out each of the unique values to the console

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output (Abe first name Lincoln last name):
```
Mikasa
Eren
Levi
Armin

```

### Example and Activity 03

#### Step 01

In the package `lab19.part_a.examples` look at the file `Example03_` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `labs.lab19.part_a.activity` complete the `Activity02_FixThisLoop` per the following:

        Create a program that returns the lowest value (minimum number) contained within an array of numbers
        Create an array of numbers containing at least 10 unique values
        Initialize a way to save the current minimum value
        Create a loop to help you iterate through the array
        Have a logical check (HINT: IF) to see if the current index of the array is less than the minimum value you initialized, if it is,
            be sure to re-assign the minimum value so that you keep the minmum
        Print out "The minimum of this array is: " then whatever the value is. Look at the sample below

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output:
```
The minimum of this array is: -20

```

## Part B

### Example and Activity 01

#### Step 01

In the package `lab19.part_b.examples` look at the file `Example01_ArrayListDemo` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `labs.lab19.part_a.activity` complete the `Activity01_ArrayList` per the following:

        Create a program with an arraylist that contains the following: Steve, Tim, Lucy, Pat, Angela, Tom
        Print this out to the console
        Remove Steve and Angela
        Print out the updated arraylist to the console
        Remove the third element by index
        Print out the updated arraylist to the console

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output (Abe first name Lincoln last name):
```
[Steve, Tim, Lucy, Pat, Angela, Tom]
[Tim, Lucy, Pat, Tom]
[Tim, Lucy, Tom]
```

> Use Example01_ArrayListDemo for reference.


### Example and Activity 02

#### Step 01

In the package `lab19.part_b.examples` look at the file `Example02_ArrayListOperations` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `labs.lab19.part_a.activity` complete the `Activity02_` per the following:

        Create a program with an arraylist of Strings
        Using the add method, add four unique values to it
        Sort the list
        Print out the contents using a loop
        Create a second list of numbers
        Using the add method, add four unique values to it
        Sort the list
        Print out the contents using a loop

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output (Abe first name Lincoln last name):
```
Apple
Banana
Grapes
Mango
Sorting numbers...
1
11
21
51
```

### Example and Activity 03

#### Step 01

In the package `lab19.part_b.examples` look at the file `Example03_ArrayListTraversing` and write comments for each line of code. When complete review with instructor.

#### Step 02

In the package `labs.lab19.part_a.activity` complete the `Activity03_Traversing` per the following:

        Create a program with an arraylist that contains five unique string elements
        Iterate through the arraylist and print out the contents to the console

Your program is working correctly, if when run, the following is the output (Abe first name Lincoln last name):
```
Gregor Clegane
Khal Drogo
Cersei Lannister
Sandor Clegane
Tyrion Lannister
```
